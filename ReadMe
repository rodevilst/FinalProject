The goal of my project is to create a platform for users to submit and manage requests, view and edit them, and track statistics related to those requests.
The application serves as a centralized hub for processing user requests and tracking their progress, providing a streamlined and organized approach to managing user interactions.
In this project, I utilized various technologies to implement a backend server that provides a RESTful API for processing user requests.
The technologies used include Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL for the database management.
Additionally, I used Postman for testing and Swagger UI for API documentation.
