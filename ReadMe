## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a platform that allows users to submit and manage requests, view and edit them, as well as track statistics related to these requests. The application serves as a centralized hub for processing user requests and tracking their progress, providing a streamlined and organized approach to managing user interactions.

In this project, I utilized various technologies to implement a backend server that provides a RESTful API for processing user requests. The technologies used include Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL for database management. Additionally, I used Postman for testing and Swagger UI for API documentation.
